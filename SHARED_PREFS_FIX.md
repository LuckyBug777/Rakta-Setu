# Shared Preferences Fix for Rakta Setu

## Summary of Changes

We've made several improvements to fix the shared preferences implementation in the Rakta Setu app:

1. Fixed the authentication flow in `splash_screen.dart`:
   - Changed from `initializeAuth()` to `isUserLoggedIn()` for more consistent auth checks
   - Ensured proper handling of authentication state transitions

2. Improved OTP verification in `otp_verification_screen.dart`:
   - Added proper user data saving with shared preferences
   - Made sure the login state is correctly persisted with `saveLoginState()`
   - Fixed the callback flow to properly notify parent components

3. Added debugging tools in `shared_prefs_debug.dart`:
   - Created utility functions to verify shared preferences are working
   - Added logging to help troubleshoot issues
   - Implemented methods to dump all preferences for debugging

4. Created an enhanced authentication service in `enhanced_auth_service.dart`:
   - Improved logging for auth-related operations
   - Better error handling for shared preferences operations
   - Added verification steps to ensure data is correctly saved

5. Updated `main.dart` to use these enhancements:
   - Added shared preferences diagnostic at startup
   - Used the enhanced auth service with better logging
   - Improved error handling throughout the app

## Troubleshooting Tips

If you continue to experience issues with shared preferences:

1. Run the app in debug mode and check the console logs for detailed information
2. Look for any errors related to shared preferences or file access
3. Try clearing app data or reinstalling on the test device
4. Ensure you have proper permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml file
5. Test on different devices to see if the issue is device-specific

## Next Steps

1. Test the login flow thoroughly on multiple devices
2. Implement a more robust error handling system
3. Consider adding offline mode support
4. Add unit tests specifically for the authentication flow
